# Catchy_Cat_Cat
This is one of the first games we made for a school project.
We had to make an old skool game using modules in JS as our main way of coding.

(We made this game for an assignment so feel free to make any changes you like as long as its not an exact copy)

## About

So like we already said, it was a game we made using modules that were described in the assingment we got. Making this game was very usefull in many ways. Since we're still in school trying to learn the best ways to code, this is a great way of learning some more Javascript and how to use modules. This game is only in v0.0.1 so no high hopes please. There is literally nothing to do besides moving the basket from left to right and staring at a timer whilst listining to some music until it runs out and you get a message saying "GAME OVER".

## Disclaimer

This is just a small project for school. So don't expect it to update every week. and PLEASE don't expect this to become a game you will enjoy longer then 2 minutes. This was purely made for the purpose of school and nothing else. We will update this game when we feel like it. Because we're very busy with other school related stuff.
